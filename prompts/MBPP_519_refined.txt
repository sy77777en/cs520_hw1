You are solving a Python programming problem. Write ONLY the complete function implementation (no explanations or markdown).

Problem:
Write a Python function to calculate the volume of a regular tetrahedron (a pyramid with four equilateral triangular faces).

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The function name must be exactly: volume_tetrahedron
- The function signature must be exactly:
  def volume_tetrahedron(num):
- The parameter `num` represents the side length of the tetrahedron.
- The formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron is:
  V = (a³) / (6 * sqrt(2))
- The result must be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Examples:
volume_tetrahedron(10) → 117.85  
volume_tetrahedron(15) → 397.75  
volume_tetrahedron(20) → 942.81

Please provide the full Python function following this exact specification.
